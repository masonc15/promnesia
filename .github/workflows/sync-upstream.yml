            The automated sync from upstream (karlicoss/promnesia) to your fork has failed.

            Workflow Run: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
            Branch: master
            Time: ${{ github.event.repository.updated_at }}

            This usually means there are merge conflicts that need manual resolution.

            To resolve manually:
            git fetch upstream
            git merge upstream/master
            # Resolve conflicts
            git push origin master
