   - Visual comparison tables
   - Links to all relevant files

6. **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/end2end_test_improvement.md`** (2KB)
   - GitHub issue template for tracking test improvements
   - Structured format for improvement proposals
   - Acceptance criteria checklist

7. **`.gitignore`** (updated)
   - Added `tests/test_artifacts/` to exclude test failure artifacts

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Test Reliability (High Priority)
- ❌ 12+ hard-coded `sleep()` calls causing flakiness
- ❌ Several tests marked as `xfail` or `skip`
- ❌ Race conditions with async operations
- ✅ **Solution provided**: `end2end_wait_utils.py` with explicit waits

### 2. Manual Confirmation (Medium Priority)
- ❌ 15+ manual confirmation points
- ❌ In headless mode, they auto-pass (not validated)
- ❌ Reduces automation value
- ✅ **Solution provided**: Examples in `end2end_test_refactored_example.py`

### 3. Test Speed (Medium Priority)
- ❌ Tests are slow (documented as such)
- ❌ No parallelization by default
- ❌ Chrome has 5-second lag after extension install
- ✅ **Solution provided**: Instructions for pytest-xdist parallelization

### 4. Error Debugging (Low Priority)
- ❌ Limited context on test failures
- ❌ No screenshots/logs captured by default
- ❌ Hard to debug headless CI failures
- ✅ **Solution provided**: `conftest_end2end.py` auto-capture plugin

## Quick Wins (Can Implement Immediately)

### 1. Use Wait Utilities
```python
# Before
from time import sleep
driver.get('https://example.com')
sleep(2)

# After
from end2end_wait_utils import wait_for_element_visible
driver.get('https://example.com')
wait_for_element_visible(driver, (By.TAG_NAME, 'body'))
```

### 2. Enable Auto-Capture
- Import `conftest_end2end` plugin (or copy content to existing conftest.py)
- Run tests - screenshots/logs auto-saved on failure to `tests/test_artifacts/`

### 3. Enable Parallel Execution
```bash
# Run tests in parallel (requires pytest-xdist, already in dependencies)
pytest -n auto tests/end2end_test.py
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Quick Wins ✅ (Provided)
- [x] Wait utilities created
- [x] Auto-capture plugin created
- [x] Parallel execution instructions provided
- [x] Refactored examples created

### Phase 2: Reliability Improvements (Recommended Next)
- [ ] Refactor top 5 flakiest tests using new utilities
- [ ] Fix or document xfail/skip tests
- [ ] Add retry mechanism for truly flaky scenarios
- [ ] Convert manual confirmations to assertions

### Phase 3: Long-term (Future)
- [ ] Restructure into feature-based test modules
- [ ] Evaluate Playwright for new tests (tools already available!)
- [ ] Implement Page Object Model
- [ ] Add visual regression testing

## Framework Comparison

| Feature | Selenium (current) | Playwright | 
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| Python Support | ✅ | ✅ |
| Auto-waiting | ❌ Manual | ✅ Built-in |
| Speed | Moderate | Fast |
| Network Interception | Limited | Full |
| Screenshots/Video | Manual | Built-in |
| Debugging | Basic | Excellent |

**Note**: Playwright tools are already available in the codebase!

## How to Use

1. **Review the documentation**: Start with `doc/END2END_TEST_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
2. **Try the utilities**: Use `end2end_wait_utils.py` in one test
3. **Study examples**: Review `end2end_test_refactored_example.py`
4. **Enable auto-capture**: Import `conftest_end2end.py`
5. **Track improvements**: Use GitHub issue template

## Metrics to Track

- **Flakiness rate**: % of tests that fail intermittently
- **Test execution time**: Total runtime
- **Manual test count**: Tests requiring human verification
- **Coverage**: % of extension features automated

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Review this PR and merge
2. 🔄 Create issues for specific test improvements
3. 🔄 Refactor 1-2 high-impact tests as proof of concept
4. 🔄 Gradually apply patterns to remaining tests
5. 🔄 Enable parallel execution in CI
